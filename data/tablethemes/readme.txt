
Hello.

Here are the third parties material I used to make this PokerTH Table Style :


1. The Floor texture was found here : 
http://www.cgtextures.com
http://www.cgtextures.com/texview.php?id=22592&PHPSESSID=b215b05e37973236cf9888579d1ade71

Since the texture from this website was not tiled, I just used a part of it and I modified it to suit my needs.
Check the PSD file in the "textures/floor" folder.


2. And for chairs, I used a free 3D model from there :
http://www.coolsc.net
http://www.coolsc.net/3D-Details/2006/11/27/1615-0.htm
...


3. I didn't use any texture for the blue carpet.

4. The "canevas" folder contains a PSD file I used to test the background image (the table style) just like it was ingame.




Thanks for using my PokerTH table style !
